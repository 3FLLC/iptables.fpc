{
* Usage:
   Check if a chain exists.

* Description:
   This function checks to see if the chain described in the parameter chain exists in the table.

* Parameters:
   - chain is a char pointer containing the name of the chain we want to check to.
   - handle is a pointer to a structure of type iptc_handle_t that was obtained by a previous call to iptc_init.

* Returns:
   - integer value 1 (true) if the chain exists;
   - integer value 0 (false) if the chain does not exist.
}
function iptc_is_chain(chain : PChar; handle : piptc_handle) : cint;
 cdecl; external IPTC_LIBRARY;

{
* Usage:
   Takes a snapshot of the rules.

* Description:
   This function must be called as initiator before any other function can be called.

* Parameters:
   - tablename is the name of the table we need to query and/or modify; this could be filter, mangle, nat, etc.

* Returns:
   Pointer to a structure of type iptc_handle_t that must be used as main parameter for the rest of functions we will call from libiptc.
   iptc_init returns the pointer to the structure or NULL if it fails.
   If this happens you can invoke iptc_strerror to get information about the error.
}
function iptc_init(tablename : PChar) : piptc_handle;
 cdecl; external IPTC_LIBRARY;

{
* Usage:
   Free snapshot that was taken by iptc_init

* Description:
   This procedure must be called to free a snapshot that was initialized by iptc_init, when the usage is completed.

* Parameters:
   - h is the pointer for the given snapshot.
}
procedure iptc_free(h : piptc_handle);
 cdecl; external IPTC_LIBRARY;

{
* Usage:
   Iterator functions to run through the chains.

* Description:
   This function returns the first chain name in the table.

* Parameters:
   - Pointer to a structure of type iptc_handle that was obtained by a previous call to iptc_init.

* Returns:
   Char pointer to the name of the chain.
}
function iptc_first_chain(handle : piptc_handle) : PChar;
 cdecl; external IPTC_LIBRARY;

{
* Usage:
   Iterator functions to run through the chains.

* Description:
   This function returns the next chain name in the table; NULL means no more chains.

* Parameters:
   - Pointer to a structure of type iptc_handle_t that was obtained by a previous call to iptc_init.

* Returns:
   Char pointer to the name of the chain.
}
function iptc_next_chain(handle : piptc_handle) : PChar;
 cdecl; external IPTC_LIBRARY;

{
* Usage:
   Get first rule in the given chain.

* Description:
   This function returns a pointer to the first rule in the given chain name; NULL for an empty chain.

* Parameters:
   - chain is a char pointer containing the name of the chain we want to get the rules to.
   - handle is a pointer to a structure of type iptc_handle_t that was obtained by a previous call to iptc_init.

* Returns:
   Returns a pointer to an ipt_entry structure containing information about the first rule of the chain.
}
function iptc_first_rule(chain : PChar; handle : piptc_handle) : pipt_entry;
 cdecl; external IPTC_LIBRARY;

{
* Usage:
   Get the next rule in the given chain.

* Description:
   This function returns a pointer to the next rule in the given chain name; NULL means the end of the chain.

* Parameters:
   - prev is a pointer to a structure of type ipt_entry that must be obtained first by a previous call to the function iptc_first_rule.
     In order to get the second and subsequent rules you have to pass a pointer to the structure containing the information about the previous
     rule of the chain.
   - handle is a pointer to a structure of type iptc_handle_t that was obtained by a previous call to iptc_init.

* Returns:
   Returns a pointer to an ipt_entry structure containing information about the next rule of the chain.
}
function iptc_next_rule (prev : pipt_entry; handle : piptc_handle) : pipt_entry;
 cdecl; external IPTC_LIBRARY;

{
* Usage:
   Get a pointer to the target name of this entry.

* Description:
   This function gets the target of the given rule. If it is an extended target, the name of that target is returned.
   If it is a jump to another chain, the name of that chain is returned. If it is a verdict (eg. DROP), that name is returned.
   If it has no target (an accounting-style rule), then the empty string is returned.
   Note that this function should be used instead of using the value of the verdict field of the ipt_entry structure directly,
   as it offers the above further interpretations of the standard verdict.

* Parameters:
   - e is a pointer to a structure of type ipt_entry that must be obtained first by a previous call to the function iptc_first_rule
     or the function iptc_next_rule.
   - handle is a pointer to a structure of type iptc_handle_t that was obtained by a previous call to iptc_init.

* Returns:
   Returns a char pointer to the target name. See Description above for more information.
}
function iptc_get_target(e : pipt_entry; handle : piptc_handle) : PChar;
 cdecl; external IPTC_LIBRARY;

{
* Usage:
   Is this a built-in chain?

* Description:
    This function is used to check if a given chain name is a built-in chain or not.

* Parameters:
   - chain is a char pointer containing the name of the chain we want to check to.
   - handle is a pointer to a structure of type iptc_handle_t that was obtained by a previous call to iptc_init.

* Returns:
   - Returns integer value 1 (true) if the given chain name is the name of a builtin chain;
   - returns integer value 0 (false) is not.
}
function iptc_builtin(chain : PChar; handle : piptc_handle) : cint;
 cdecl; external IPTC_LIBRARY;

{
* Usage:
   Get the policy of a given built-in chain.

* Description:
   This function gets the policy of a built-in chain, and fills in the counters argument with the hit statistics on that policy.

* Parameters:
   - chain is the built-in chain you want to get the policy to.
   - counter is a pointer to an ipt_counters structure to be filled by the function
   - handle is a pointer to a structure of type iptc_handle_t structure identifying the table we are working to that was obtained
     by a previous call to iptc_init.

* Returns:
   Returns a char pointer to the policy name.
