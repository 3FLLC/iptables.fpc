   - Returns integer value 1 (true) if successful;
   - returns integer value 0 (false) if fails. In this case errno is set to the error number generated.

   Use iptc_strerror to get a meaningful information about the problem.
   If errno = 0, it means there was a version error (ie. upgrade libiptc).

{
* Usage:
   Set counters of a rule in a chain.

* Description:
   This function set packet and byte counters of the entry rule in chain chain positioned at rulenum with
   values passed in a type structure ipt_counters. Rule numbers start at 1 for the first rule.

* Parameters:
   - chain is a char pointer to the name of the chain to be modified;
   - rulenum is an integer value defined the position in the chain of rules of the rule which counters will be set.
   - counters is a pointer to an ipt_counters structure to be used to set the counters of the rule;
     the programmer must fill the fields of this structure with values to be set.
   - handle is a pointer to a structure of type iptc_handle_t that was obtained by a previous call to iptc_init.

* Returns:
   - Returns integer value 1 (true) if successful;
   - returns integer value 0 (false) if fails. In this case errno is set to the error number generated.

   Use iptc_strerror to get a meaningful information about the problem.
   If errno = 0, it means there was a version error (ie. upgrade libiptc).

 cdecl; external IPTC_LIBRARY;

{
* Usage:
   Makes the actual changes.

* Description:
   The tables that you change are not written back until the iptc_commit() function is called.
   This means it is possible for two library users operating on the same chain to race each other;
   locking would be required to prevent this, and it is not currently done.
   There is no race with counters, however; counters are added back in to the kernel in such a way that counter
   increments between the reading and writing of the table still show up in the new table.
   To protect the status of the system you must commit your changes.

* Parameters:
   - handle is a pointer to a structure of type iptc_handle_t that was obtained by a previous call to iptc_init.

* Returns:
   - Returns integer value 1 (true) if successful;
   - returns integer value 0 (false) if fails. In this case errno is set to the error number generated.

   Use iptc_strerror to get a meaningful information about the problem.
   If errno = 0, it means there was a version error (ie. upgrade libiptc).

{
* Usage:
   Translates error numbers into more human-readable form.

* Description:
   This function returns a more meaningful explanation of a failure code in the iptc library.
   If a function fails, it will always set errno. This value can be passed to iptc_strerror() to yield an error message.

* Parameters:
   - err is an integer indicating the error number.

* Returns:
   Char pointer containing the error description.
